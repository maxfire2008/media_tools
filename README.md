Works on my machine. It probably won't on yours - but should be trivial to setup. Feel free to contact me at any of the contact methods listed on [https://maxstuff.net](https://maxstuff.net)

## Usage
Drag and drop your video/audio clip onto 25MB_video_compress.bat to compress it to 25MB (duh). This can be altered to be any size by simply copying the file and changing the argument inside (tiny sizes WIP).
